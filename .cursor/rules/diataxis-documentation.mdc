# Diátaxis Documentation Framework Rule

All documentation in this project must be created and organized according to the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which provides a systematic approach to technical documentation.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation must be organized into four distinct types, each serving a specific purpose:

### Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)
- **Purpose**: Introduce, educate, and lead users through learning experiences
- **Question answered**: "Can you teach me to...?"
- **Orientation**: Learning
- **Form**: Lessons that provide complete learning experiences
- **Location**: `docs/tutorials/`

### How-to Guides (Task-Oriented)
- **Purpose**: Help users achieve specific goals
- **Question answered**: "How do I...?"
- **Orientation**: Goals and user needs
- **Form**: Step-by-step instructions focused on user projects
- **Location**: `docs/how-to/`

### Reference (Information-Oriented)
- **Purpose**: Describe the machinery and provide technical information
- **Question answered**: "What is...?"
- **Orientation**: Information
- **Form**: Dry, factual descriptions
- **Location**: `docs/reference/`

### Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)
- **Purpose**: Illuminate topics and provide understanding
- **Question answered**: "Why...?"
- **Orientation**: Understanding
- **Form**: Discursive explanations and discussions
- **Location**: `docs/explanation/`

## Writing Principles

### How-to Guides Must Address User Problems
- Write from the user's perspective, not the machinery's perspective
- Focus on what users need to accomplish, not what the system can do
- Address human projects and real-world needs
- Tools should appear as incidental means to user ends

### Work Iteratively
- Make small, responsive improvements rather than large rewrites
- Choose any piece of documentation and assess it critically
- Make single, immediate improvements and publish them
- Avoid planning and top-down workflows in favor of emergent patterns

### Quality Standards
- Each piece of content should have one clear job to do
- Content should be clearly distinguished from other documentation types
- Focus on meaningfulness and purpose rather than just functionality
- Ensure content serves user needs effectively

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use Diátaxis as a guide, not a plan - it's a map to check direction
- Work one step at a time, publishing improvements immediately
- Don't try to work on the big picture - take small steps toward goals
- Assess existing documentation critically according to Diátaxis standards
- Focus on user needs and meaningful outcomes rather than tool functionality
